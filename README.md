# Greact

Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content. Greact has been created to render layout as easy as a pie for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) users.
Greact is based on [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) and don't have any css dependencies. Keep in mind that flexbox are well supported by most of modern browsers however you can check the compatibility [here](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox)
